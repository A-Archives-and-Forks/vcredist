# VisualCppRedist AIO

## Overview:

- AIO Repack for latest Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable Runtimes, without the original setup bloat payload.

- Built upon VBCRedist_AIO_x86_x64.exe by **@ricktendo64**

- The process is handled by a windows command script, which runs hidden in the background by default.

- Before installation, the script will check and remove existing non-compliant Visual C++ Runtimes, including the original EXE or MSI setups, or older MSI packages versions.

- The uninstallation option/script will remove any detected VC++ runtimes (except UCRT).

- You can extract the installer file with 7-zip or WinRar to a short path, and run Installer.cmd as administrator

- By design, Microsoft Windows Installer creates restore point for each msi package, if System Restore is active.

Examples:

Automatically install all packages and display progress:

Silently install all packages and display no progress:  
VisualCppRedist_AIO_x86_x64.exe /ai /gm2

Silently install 2022/2026 package:  
VisualCppRedist_AIO_x86_x64.exe /ai9 /gm2

Silently install 2010/2012/2013 and Extra VB/C packages:  
VisualCppRedist_AIO_x86_x64.exe /aiX23E

Silently install all packages and hide ARP entries:  
VisualCppRedist_AIO_x86_x64.exe /aiA /gm2

Only update already installed packages:  
VisualCppRedist_AIO_x86_x64.exe /ai1
```
</details>

- **/y** gives the same default behavior, but without the beginning and finish prompts  

- only **/sfxlang** and **/gm2** can be specified separately with other switches

- if other switches are specified separately together, only the last one will have an effect.

Example, this will only install Extra VB/C package:  
`/ai5 /ai8 /aiT /aiE`

- to install separate packages together, combine their latest switch character after **/ai**

Example:  
`/ai58X239E`

- you should not combine modes switches, this will cause unforseen errors.

Example for **wrong** usage:  
`/ai1FMU`

- **/sfxlang** must be the first switch to have effect.

Example:  
`/sfxlang:1031 /aiV`

- running `/ai9` on Windows 7/8/8.1 will install VC++ 2022 package.

- to force installing stable VC++ 2022 package on Win 10/11:

manually uninstall any VC++ 2026 runtimes

manually uninstall any VC++ 2022 runtimes with version 14.50.xxxxxx or later

run the installer with switch `/ai7`
